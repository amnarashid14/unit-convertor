I made a unit convertor using python and streamlit that supports conversion between varius units,similar to Google's unit convertor.It converts without using LLM means rely on predefined formulas and logic.
 
Features
✅ Supports multiple unit categories (length, weight, time, pressure, force, volume, energy)
✅ Graphical UI for easy interaction
✅ Uses accurate conversion formulas
✅ Lightweight and fast performance

🛠️ Installation
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

1️⃣ Open Your Browser

2️⃣ Copy Command:

3️⃣ Hit Enter and then the Digital Unit Convertor's screen will be displayed 

📚 Supported Unit Categories:

Length: meter, kilometer, mile, foot, inch, etc.
Weight: gram, kilogram, pound, ounce, ton, etc.
Time: second, minute, hour, day, week, month, etc.
Force: Newton, Dyne, Pound-force, Kip, etc.
Pressure: Pascal, Bar, Torr, Atmosphere, Psi, etc.
Energy: Joule, Calorie, Electron Volt, BTU, etc.
Volume: Liter, Gallon, Cubic Meter, Hectoliter, etc.

📝 How to Use
1️⃣ Select the category (e.g., length, weight, time).
2️⃣ Enter the source unit and target unit (e.g., meters to miles).
3️⃣ Input the value to convert.
4️⃣ Get the converted result instantly!

Example:

Enter category: Length
Convert from: Kilometer
Convert to: Mile
Enter value: 10
Result: 10 kilometers = 6.2137 miles

⚙️ How It Works
The converter uses a dictionary-based approach for conversion factors.
User input is validated to avoid errors.
Results are calculated using predefined formulas for accuracy.

📌 Future Improvements
✅ Support for more units and categories
✅ Add currency conversion feature
✅ Will connect to LLM
